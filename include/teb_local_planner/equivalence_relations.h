/**
 * @class EquivalenceClass
 * @brief Abstract class that defines an interface for computing and comparing equivalence classes
 *
 * Equivalence relations are utilized in order to test if two trajectories are belonging to the same
 * equivalence class w.r.t. the current obstacle configurations. A common equivalence relation is
 * the concept of homotopy classes. All trajectories belonging to the same homotopy class
 * can CONTINUOUSLY be deformed into each other without intersecting any obstacle. Hence they likely
 * share the same local minimum after invoking (local) trajectory optimization. A weaker equivalence relation
 * is defined by the concept of homology classes (e.g. refer to HSignature).
 *
 * Each EquivalenceClass object (or subclass) stores a candidate value which might be compared to another EquivalenceClass object.
 *
 * @remarks Currently, the computeEquivalenceClass method is not available in the generic interface EquivalenceClass.
 *          Call the "compute"-methods directly on the subclass.
